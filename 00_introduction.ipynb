    "\n",

    "*Pointers encourage implicit changes rather than explicit. Often, they are complex instead of simple, especially for beginners. Even worse, they beg for ways to shoot yourself in the foot, or do something really dangerous like read from a section of memory you were not supposed to.Python tends to try to abstract away implementation details like memory addresses from its users. Python often focuses on usability instead of speed. As a result, pointers in Python doesnâ€™t really make sense.*\n",

    "Mutable objects can be changed, immutable cannot. I.e. when a new value is assigned to a given immutable \"variable\", a new object is in reality created. This as \"variable\" in python are actually just names bound to objects (PyObject).\n",
    "When you change the value of an immutable variable and check its address with id(variable) you'll see that the address actually changed.\n",
